# Web Application Penetration Testing Report

## 🔒 Introduction
This repository contains a **comprehensive Web Application Penetration Testing (WAPT) report**, highlighting security assessments performed on a sample web application. The goal of this report is to identify vulnerabilities, assess their impact, and provide actionable remediation strategies to enhance web security.

## 📌 About the Report
This WAPT report documents the results of **ethical hacking** and security assessments conducted using industry-standard tools. The report provides insights into various vulnerabilities, including:
- **SQL Injection**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **Authentication & Authorization Flaws**
- **Security Misconfigurations**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**
- **Broken Access Control**

## 🛠️ Tools & Methodologies Used
The penetration testing was performed using the following tools:
